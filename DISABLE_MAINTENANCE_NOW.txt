Issue: Maintenance page stuck after successful deployment
Status: Workflow #47 completed successfully but maintenance page still active

CRITICAL: Need to force disable maintenance page immediately!

Actions:
1. Remove all maintenance.html files from server
2. Reload nginx configuration  
3. Verify site is accessible
