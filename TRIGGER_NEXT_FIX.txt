TRIGGER: FORCE AUTO-FIX-502 SCRIPT EXECUTION
==========================================

Timestamp: 2025-08-11 14:55:00
Issue: Site still shows 502 after workflow #45 success
Fix: Force execution of auto-fix-502.sh script

CRITICAL: This triggers GitHub Actions to run the comprehensive auto-fix script
that should resolve all 502 issues by:
- Installing dependencies
- Building application
- Starting PM2 with correct Next.js path
- Verifying port 3000 is working

WORKFLOW #45 WAS SUCCESS BUT SITE STILL 502 - NEED FORCE TRIGGER!
