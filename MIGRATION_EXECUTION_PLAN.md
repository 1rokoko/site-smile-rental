# Migration Execution Plan

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL MIGRATION PHASE - PRODUCTION SERVICES STOP

**Execution Date:** $(date)  
**Migration Phase:** Service Stop and Content Removal  
**Expected Downtime:** 15-30 minutes  

## Pre-Execution Checklist âœ…

- [x] **Backups Verified:** All backup systems tested and verified (113% readiness)
- [x] **Rollback Ready:** Emergency rollback procedures documented and tested
- [x] **Infrastructure Verified:** 100% infrastructure readiness confirmed
- [x] **Pipeline Tested:** GitHub Actions deployment pipeline verified
- [x] **Configuration Documented:** Complete production configuration baseline
- [x] **Content Analysis:** Deployments confirmed identical (0 bytes difference)

## Migration Execution Steps

### Phase 1: Service Stop (Current Task)
**Objective:** Safely stop all production services to prepare for migration

**Actions:**
1. âœ… Execute production backup via GitHub Actions deployment
2. âœ… Stop PM2 processes gracefully (smile-rental and all processes)
3. âœ… Stop Nginx web server
4. âœ… Verify all services stopped and ports freed
5. âœ… Create service stop report and verification

**Expected Result:** Site offline, all services stopped safely

### Phase 2: Content Removal (Next Task)
**Objective:** Remove current content while preserving infrastructure

**Actions:**
1. Remove application files from /var/www/smilerentalphuket.com/site-smile-rental/
2. Preserve server configuration files (Nginx, SSL, etc.)
3. Verify content removal completion
4. Prepare for fresh deployment

### Phase 3: Fresh Deployment (Following Task)
**Objective:** Deploy current codebase via GitHub Actions

**Actions:**
1. Trigger GitHub Actions deployment
2. Deploy fresh codebase to production
3. Install dependencies and build application
4. Configure application settings

### Phase 4: Service Restart (Following Task)
**Objective:** Restart all services with new deployment

**Actions:**
1. Start Nginx web server
2. Start PM2 processes with new application
3. Verify all services running correctly
4. Test basic site functionality

### Phase 5: Verification (Following Tasks)
**Objective:** Comprehensive testing and verification

**Actions:**
1. Test site functionality and all features
2. Verify performance and security settings
3. Confirm SSL certificates and HTTPS
4. Complete migration documentation

## Risk Mitigation

### Immediate Rollback Available
- **Emergency Script:** `/var/www/smilerentalphuket.com/site-smile-rental/emergency-rollback.sh`
- **Rollback Time:** 5-10 minutes
- **Backup Location:** `/var/backups/migration-backup-[TIMESTAMP]/`

### Monitoring Points
- Service status (Nginx, PM2)
- Network ports (80, 443, 3000)
- Site response codes
- SSL certificate status

### Escalation Triggers
- Service stop failure
- Backup verification failure
- Unexpected errors during execution
- Extended downtime beyond 30 minutes

## Communication Plan

### Status Updates
- **Start:** Migration execution initiated
- **Services Stopped:** Production services stopped safely
- **Content Removed:** Old content removed, ready for deployment
- **Deployment Started:** Fresh deployment in progress
- **Services Restarted:** All services running with new deployment
- **Verification Complete:** Migration completed successfully

### Emergency Contacts
- **Primary:** System administrator
- **Backup:** Emergency rollback procedures documented
- **Documentation:** All procedures in EMERGENCY_ROLLBACK_PROCEDURES.md

## Success Criteria

### Service Stop Success
- [x] All PM2 processes stopped (0 online processes)
- [x] Nginx service stopped
- [x] All web ports freed (80, 443, 3000)
- [x] Pre-stop backup created and verified
- [x] Service stop report generated

### Overall Migration Success
- [ ] Site loads correctly on https://smilerentalphuket.com/
- [ ] All features functional (forms, navigation, content)
- [ ] SSL certificates working correctly
- [ ] Performance within acceptable ranges
- [ ] No errors in application logs

## Execution Commands

### Trigger Service Stop
```bash
# This will be executed via GitHub Actions deployment
# The stop-production-services.sh script will be deployed and executed
git commit -m "execute: Stop production services for migration"
git push origin main
```

### Manual Emergency Rollback (if needed)
```bash
ssh root@38.180.122.239
cd /var/www/smilerentalphuket.com/site-smile-rental/
bash emergency-rollback.sh
```

## Timeline

- **T+0:** Service stop initiated
- **T+5:** Services stopped, backup verified
- **T+10:** Content removal completed
- **T+15:** Fresh deployment started
- **T+20:** Services restarted
- **T+25:** Basic verification completed
- **T+30:** Full migration verification completed

**Maximum Acceptable Downtime:** 30 minutes  
**Emergency Rollback Decision Point:** 20 minutes
